-Adding a new search catagory-
1. In "Domain\Search\Attributes.cs" add your new catagory to the enums
2. Make a new page type in "Domain\Pages\" I sugest duplicating one that exists.
3. In "Domain\Search\SearchResult.cs" add you new catagory to the catagory getter.

FYI:
  The way that "Domain\Search\SearchResult.cs" is tied to your new catagory type you placed in "Domain\Pages\" is through the SearchField items such as "[SCResultField(SearchField.Thumbnail)]". In your new class you define what gets sent to the search results. The corasponding items in each file will have the "[SCSearchField(SearchField.thing)]".
