--- Notes ---
-It’s also important to note that special characters in queries need to be escaped with a hash, for example, a hyphen in a query will break the parser and needs to be handled by being wrapped in #.

-You can also do multiple parameters using 'and' like this /sitecore/content/Westwood/Home/#request-info#/descendant::*[@State="{4F477E23-2D62-46E3-AF4F-102AC64A98E5}" and @Content Type="{85DB130C-AFA7-4FA2-AB90-D871CFF23221}"]

-You can also search for part of a field using contails like this 
//*[contains(@Title, 'Sitecore')]

-The difference between '/sitecore/content/*' and '/sitecore/content//*' is that the /* will return the items children non-recursivly, but when using //* it will return the items children and all decendents.

--- In Code ---
Sitecore.Data.Database database = Sitecore.Data.Database.GetDatabase("master"); 
Sitecore.Data.Items.Item[] items = database.SelectItems("fast:/sitecore/content/home/#big-shapes#/*");
